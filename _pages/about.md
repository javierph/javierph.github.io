Hi, I’m Javier. I love mathematics so I became a mathematician. However, my passion for computers and the web made me an experienced java developer.

But I can’t stop learning so I’m always browsing books and studying new fields. Recently I discovered the fascinating world of Data Science. It comprises maths, programming languages, creativity… and it helps to solve many kinds of problems!. What more could you ask for?.
