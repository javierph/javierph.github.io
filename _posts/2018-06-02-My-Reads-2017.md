Let's see briefly what happened in 2017. (Tools used: [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com), [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Highcharts](http://highcharts.com/) wrapped by [Highcharter](http://jkunst.com/highcharter)


## Year evolution

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_ITI5079.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_ITI5079.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

This year the evolution is more uniform. *The Stand* by Stephen King makes pages per book increase in February, but then several short books lower the average. In August, the number of books grows, but the number of pages is fairly constant along the year.


## Analysis per month

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_ABZ8013.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_ABZ8013.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

August: the month I read more books but the shortest ones. May: the month when I read only large books


## Histograms

### Books by number of pages
If we divide books by size, how many of them are there in each group?

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_HTS4453.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_HTS4453.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

The largest group is the one with books with a number of pages between 300 and 399.


### Books by publication year
What about divide books by their publication year?

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_TJM3009.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_TJM3009.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

Nothing changes here. I still read more modern books than classics.


### Books by rating

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_IVX3234.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_IVX3234.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

Poorer ratings than I wold like...


### Authors by number of books

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_KDX5011.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_KDX5011.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

In this year, I have read more than one book by the same author six times, and no more than two books per author.


## Comparing books characteristics
<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_WKP9060.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_WKP9060.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

This year I read more fiction than non-fiction books, more standalone books than series and more books written by male than by female authors. The last two cases are more balanced than in 2016.


## Summary

### Heatmap
Always a funny kind of graph. Darker colors indicates lower values and lighter colors indicates higher values.

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_WCT6086.html" style="height: 270px;"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_WCT6086.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

Some highlights:

 * I agree with the community saying that *In Order to Live: A North Korean Girl's Journey to Freedom* is a great book.
 * Stefan Zweig's books are the oldest and the shortest ones


### Scatterplot
2017 at a glance

<div class="chart"><iframe src="/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_OAO2146.html"></iframe></div>[Open](/htmlwidgets/2018-06-02-My-Reads-2017/highchart_OAO2146.html){: .btn .btn--inverse target="_blank"}

This year the pairs most similar are *The Novice* - *The High Lord* (obvious since they are from the same series and author), and *Redshirts* - *Prince of Thorns*, a not so obvious relation...
